## 📝 Option 1: Create Repository First (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: `gst-billing` (or any name)
3. Description: "Multi-Hotel GST Billing System"
4. Set to **Public** or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you commands. Copy the repository URL:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
Run this command (replace with your URL):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
